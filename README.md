# Flakey Tests are Flakey

A flaky test is a test that will pass and fail periodically, without having any code changes. These tests are not only insanely annoying, but add up in cost as they often need to be ran again and again, and each time you're waiting for new builds to finish successfully. On top of that, there's a lack of confidence in your tests - how do you feel good about releasing when you don't know if you're getting a true passing test or not?
